# LeetCode_for_DataScience

As Data Science thrives, the requirement of code ability is getting stricter than before. Almost all company will conduct a coding interview for Data Scientist, and LeetCode is the best source to hone our coding skills. Nevertheless, there is no specific column for Data Science, therefore, finding questions specific echo for data science is somehow time-consuming. Fortunately, `cspiration.com` provided a clear classified cloumns for not only SDE but also DS.  

For more information, lick [here](https://cspiration.com/leetcodeClassification)


Here I provided a solution and classified table for the DS LeetCode mass table. 

Each questions' difficulty is from [here](https://github.com/grandyang/leetcode)

Acording my classified table, you can:  
	1. Start coding from specific category  
	2. Within each category, start from Easy to Hard.
